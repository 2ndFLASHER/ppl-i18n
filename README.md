This repository contains the translated strings for the game [PewPew Live](https://pewpew.live).
## Contributing
Any contribution helps, even if its only a few words or phrases.
(but please only contribute to languages you can speak; no Google Translate)

For information on how to submit changes on GitHub, take a look at this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository).

If you contribute a significant amount, I'll put you in the credits!

A few tips for contributing:
* Keep the `%s` as they later get replaced by some other text.
* The text fragments that look like `#ffffffff` encode colors. Keep them!
* Try to have the translations be approximately the same length as the English text.
* Don't hesitate the reword the text to better fit the language.
* In order to reduce merge conflicts, avoid working on a single pull request for multiple days. It's better if you create one pull request per day.
## Adding new languages
If you want to add support for a new language, create a GitHub Issue so that we can discuss
the feasibility.
